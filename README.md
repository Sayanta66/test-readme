Welcome to [Syself's](https://syself.com/) GitHub space, where we showcase our state-of-the-art open-source developmental projects that helped in building practical, efficient Kubernetes solutions. Our focus is on creating tools that not only solve real-world problems but also inspire and engage the developer community. 

## Who are we?
Syself is a privately-held company headquartered in Germany specializing in Kubernetes-managed services with a worldwide distributed international team. We offer easy-to-use and production-ready Kubernetes clusters to support the growth of your business. With our open-source products, you can simplify the management of your Kubernetes clusters, streamline your application deployment, and tackle scalability challenges. With 24*7 support available, we are committed to ensuring that your Kubernetes operations are seamless. 

## Syself Autopilot: Our own Kubernetes platform and a developer's playground
Syself Autopilot is our answer to the future of Kubernetes management. The goal of Autopilot is to simplify the use of Kubernetes as a platform. Autopilot essentially enhances Cluster-API by adding extra features and automation that operate behind the scenes. It provides you with a management cluster, which serves as a central point for interactively managing Kubernetes objects that define your clusters.

### Key features

## Syself Services
Syself is always ready to assist you in the Kubernetes journey of your business. We use an infrastructure-as-software approach to create a reliable, scalable, and automatic system that allows the management of Kubernetes clusters. It provides a high grade of hands-free operation by getting enabled to react in certain situations autonomously.   

## Open-Source with Syself
From the start, Syself has always been a big fan and firm supporter of open-source technologies and contributions. This has led to:

**Active Community Contributions**: We have always been motivated by our active contributions to the Kubernetes family of projects, including involvement in projects like cluster-api and cluster-api-operator.

**Building with Developers in Mind**: Our platform is developed by developers, for developers. We understand the intricacies of Kubernetes and strive to simplify its complexity while maintaining its powerful capabilities.

### Our Projects
We have a core focus on open-source from the start and that led to the development of some of the amazing projects with notable infrastructure providers like Hetzner and Hivelocity and organizations like Sovereign Cloud Stack. The notable projects are listed below:
- **[Kubernetes ClusterAPI Provider Hetzner](https://github.com/syself/cluster-api-provider-hetzner)**: The Kubernetes Cluster-API Provider Hetzner is a Cluster-API integrator that enables declarative provisioning of multiple Kubernetes clusters on infrastructure provider [Hetzner](https://hetzner.cloud/).
- **[Helm Charts](https://github.com/syself/charts)**: The helm charts help you manage Kubernetes applications.
- **[Kubernetes ClusterAPI Provider Hivelocity](https://github.com/hivelocity/cluster-api-provider-hivelocity)**: The Kubernetes ClusterAPI provider for Hivelocity is a Kubernetes-native tool that allows you to manage Kubernetes clusters on [Hivelocity's](https://www.hivelocity.net/) infrastructure.
- **[Hivelocity Cloud Controller Manager](https://github.com/hivelocity/hivelocity-cloud-controller-manager)**: This cloud controller manager has been developed by Syself for the infrastructure provider Hivelocity.
- **[Cluster Stack Operator](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stack-operator)**: The Cluster Stack Operator works with [Cluster Stacks](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks) and creates Kubernetes clusters in an easy and [Cluster-API](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api)-native way.
- **[Csmctl](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/csmctl)**: Csmctl is a tool used for developing cluster stack releases and building node image artifacts on the desired container registry.
